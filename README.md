# FZJ-Weather Prometheus Exporter
The FZJ-Weather Prometheus Exporter (short: exporter) is an exporter compatible
with the Prometheus database. It consists of two parts:
  1. `fzj_weather.py`: a python script using BeautifulSoup4 and requests to
     parse and return meteorological data from a weather station inside the
     Forschungszentrum Jülich (short: FZJ). It does so by parsing the website
     providing the information.
  2. exporter (`main.py`): uses said script to receive, parse and provide
     the data to the Prometheus database. Once started, it runs indefinitely until interrupt.

`main.py` references the weather script and other needed scripts. It therefore
marks the entry point of the exporter.

## Install
1. Install the package from the corresponding GitHub Repository:
    `pip install git+https://github.com/psyinfra/prometheus_fzj_weather_exporter.git`
2. Start the exporter:
    `prometheus_fzj_weather_exporter`

## Test
To test the exporter, you can host the script on your own machine:
  1. `prometheus_fzj_weather_exporter`
  2. (from another terminal) `curl 127.0.0.1:9840`

Running `curl 127.0.0.1:9840` should give you an output of similar structure
like this:
```
# HELP fzj_weather_air_temperature temperature in celsius
# TYPE fzj_weather_air_temperature gauge
fzj_weather_air_temperature 14.0
```
(The output should be similar for other data points, i.e. humidity)

## Usage
```
usage: prometheus_fzj_weather_exporter [-h] [-i] [-w LISTEN_ADDRESS]

Set up the Prometheus exporter (connection ports)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --insecure        skip SSL validation of the weather website
  -w LISTEN_ADDRESS, --web.listen-address LISTEN_ADDRESS
                        address and port to expose metrics and web interface. Default: `:9840`
                        To listen on all interfaces, omit the IP. `:<port>`
                        To listen on a specific IP: `<address>:<port>`
```
